# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-WIP
This project explores a basic machine learning approach to predicting Bitcoin prices using historical market data. The objective is to build a foundational understanding of data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation in the context of financial time series forecasting.

Please note that this is an early-stage, work-in-progress project developed primarily for learning purposes. The model and results may be limited in accuracy and are not intended for real-world financial decision-making.
